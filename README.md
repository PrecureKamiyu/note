# note
This is note. You can download the tex file or pdf file. 

If you want to compile the tex file yourself, please use `xelatex --shell-escape` command

Note that most of the notes can barely be notes. I mean, they are just not so good to read. 

Oh, some notes are written in English. You should be careful about the chinglish in the notes.
