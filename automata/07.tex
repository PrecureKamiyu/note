\section{The Normal Form of grammar}
\label{sec:The Normal Form of grammar}

There are two kinds of normal forms that we should know, which are \textbf{Chomsky Normal Form} and \textbf{Greibach Normal Form}. 
The definitions have been introduced in previous chapter. You should check them out.

This section is on its place. However, it has been learned in previous chapter. You may 
check previous chapter for more info.

\subsection{The content of Pump Lemma}
\begin{thm}[Pump Lemma]
\label{Pump Lemma}
Let \(L \) be the language of a grammar. Then there exist \(n\) that if \(|z| \ge n\), then \(z = uvwxy\), suit the following 
conditions: 

	\bigskip
	\setlength{\hangindent}{33pt}
	1. \(| v w x | \le n\). That is to say \( |v  w x |  \) can't be too long.

	\smallskip
	2. \(v x \ne\epsilon\). Since \(v,  x \) are the pieces to be pumped, \(v\) or \(x\) should not be zero, that is to 
	say, \(v\) and \(x\) can be both empty, \emph{and} that is to say \( v x \ne\epsilon\).

	\smallskip 
	3. For all \(i \ge 0\), \(u v ^{i} w x ^{i} y\) is in \(L\).
\end{thm}

\subsection{The application of Pump Lemma}
Similarly, the Pump Lemma is used to prove a language \(L\) is not a context free language. Let us restate the lemma using the 
mathematical logic. If \(L\) is a context free language then 
\[
\exists n \in N \ \forall\alpha \in L (\forall uvwxy =\alpha (|v w x | \le n , vx \ne\epsilon \to  u v ^{i} w x ^{i} y \in L))
\]
Let the proposition above be \(A\), then we have \(L \text{ is CFL} \to A\). Thus, we have \(\neg A \to L \text{ is not CFL}\). 
And \(\neg A\) equates 
\[
\forall n \in N ,\exists\alpha \in L ,\exists u v w x y = \alpha (\neg  (|vwx| \le n , vx \ne \epsilon \to u v ^{i} w x ^{i} y \in L))
\]
So we have the procedure here, similar to the one in previous chapter about the formal expressions, that we check for every \(n\) in \(\mathbb{N}\), considering as a random variable\footnote{not that variable}, and find a \(\alpha \in L\), and prove that for all kinds of \( uvw xy\), there exists \(i\) s.t. \( u v ^{i} w x ^{i}y\) is not in \(L\), where we often discuss about the different conditions. 

\begin{exam}
	Use pump lemma to show that \(L = \{ 0 ^{n} 1 ^{n} 2 ^{n} \mid n \ge 1 \}\) is not context free language.
\end{exam}
There is another example to show that the grammar can't describe the string that have two pairs of equal numbers of symbols. 
\begin{exam}
	Let \(L = \{ 0 ^{i} 1 ^{j} 2 ^{i} 3 ^{j} \}\). Use pump lemma to prove that \(L\) is not context free language. 
\end{exam}
Mover, since pushdown automata are equivalent to context free grammar, you can easily see that (not prove that) 
\(L =  \{ ww\}\) is not context  free language. 
\begin{exam}
	Let \(L = \{ ww \}\). Use pump lemma to prove that \(L\) is not context free language.

	Given a \(n\), we shall prove that if \(z \in L\), and \(z  =  uv w xy\), we have that \( u w y\) does not in \(L\) which leads to
	contradiction.  We shall let \(z =  0 ^{n} 1 ^{n} 0 ^{n} 1 ^{n}\).

	\medskip
	1. Let us talk about \( v w x \) first. Since \( |v w x | \le n\), we assume that \(v w x \) is all in the first 
	block of \(0\)'s. Let \( |v x |\) be \(k\). Then, \( |  u w y | = 4n - k\) and moreover, since \(v w x\) is all 
	in the first block, \( u w y \) starts with \( 0 ^{n - k} 1 ^{n}\) for sure. If \( u w  y = tt\) for some \(t\),
	then \( |t| = 2n - k/2 \ge 2n - k\), viz., the length of \(t\) is longer than that of \( 0 ^{n - k} 1 ^{n}\), and 
	thus \(t\) should end with \(0\). However, \( uwy \) ends with \(1\). If \( u wy\) is \(tt\) then it should have ended 
	with \(0\) since \(t\) end with \(0\), which, leads to a contradiction.
	\medskip

	2. Suppose that \( v w x\) straddles the first block of \(0\)'s and the first block of \(1\)'s.	
	The same, we assume that \( u w y\) can written as \(tt\). Since \(k\), which is the length of 
	\(v x\), is no bigger than \(n\)\footnote{That is because \(|v w x| \le n\)}, we have \( |uwy| \ge 3n\).
	Thus \( |t | \le 3n / 2\). There are two possiblily: 1. \( v x \) contains no \(1\); 2, \(v x\) contains 
	at least one \(1\). For situation 1., the discussion in (1) is also applied. For situation 2., We assert 
	that \(t\) does not end with \(1 ^{n}\), for there is at least one \(1\) in \(v x\) and it is deleted from 
	\(z\), while \( uw y\) ends with \(1^{n}\), which is for sure.

	\medskip 
	3. The further discussion is omitted here.  You can check page 285 of the textbook for help.
